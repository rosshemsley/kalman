# Examples

The examples are kept separate from the main module to allow them to use different dependencies from the main package.

You can compile and run the examples using

```bash
go get github.com/rosshemsley/kalman/examples/...
```

This will install the example binaries for running: `trajectory-example` and `time-series-example`.
Running each of these produces a `plot.png` file with the output.
